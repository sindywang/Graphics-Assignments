CPS511 Assignment 1
 
For this assignment I used Microsoft Visual Studio
To run the code:
Create a new project in Visual Studio
Theres a HTML file that shows you how to set up a new project linked
After doing that, put all the C and header files into the source files 
section in the project
Press run, and if there an error about a freeglut.dll file, go to your
freeglut folder and go into bin and copy freeglut.dll
Now to go the project folder and into the Debug folder, paste the freeglut.dll
file there.
After that the program should run.
